## Tunable electronic bands in twisted bilayer NbSe2

__Following observation of unconventional superconductive effects in twisted bilayer gra­
phene, the novel field of ’twistronics’ has seen a rapid progression in theory and exper­
imentation. When a van der Waals heterostructure formed from a bilayer of 2D lattices
is twisted at a so­called ’magic­angle’, perturbation effects and interlayer tunneling lead
to the formation of a flat electronic band at the Fermi level in some materials. These
exotic electronic properties mean that these materials have the potential to be exploited
as high temperature superconductors or in novel electronic devices. Using a multior­
bital tight binding model, we model a bilayer of transition metal dichalcogenide 2H­
NbSe2 with interlayer tunneling at various twist angles. We observe splitting of elec­
tronic bands at degenerate eigenvalues, leading to flat electronic bands near the Fermi
level for some twist angles. Our results show potential for further modelling of twisted
bilayer NbSe2 to affirm these promising properties.__
