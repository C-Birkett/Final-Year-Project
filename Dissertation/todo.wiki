== Work ==

- [ ] Projection onto unperturbed evectors/states
  - [ ] get the 4 unperturbed d orbital evectors/states at fermi level
  - [ ] project the 84 evalues (maybe just the bottom 28? or even just 4 at the original k0??) onto the 4 to get the probability - should be < 1
  - [ ] figure out a way to plot the 4 unperturbed, with the 28 overtop
    - [ ] 28 overtop should then be greyscaled acccording to projection
    - [ ] interpret at what k points the electronic band is more or less projected onto the unperturbed state
    - [ ] speak to marcin - interpret results
    - [ ] look at different angles

- [ ] tunneling coefficient gaussian
  - [ ] figure out decent fitting parameters for gaussian
  - [ ] implement gaussian as function of k, G
  - [ ] in hamiltonian swap constants with gaussian values
  - [ ] plot bands
  - [ ] interpret

- [ ] get a variety of plots for write up
