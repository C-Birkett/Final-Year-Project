_dissertation todo_

== Work ==

- [O] Projection onto unperturbed evectors/states
  - [X] get the 4 unperturbed d orbital evectors/states at fermi level
  - [X] project the 84 evalues (maybe just the bottom 28? or even just 4 at the original k0??) onto the 4 to get the probability - should be < 1
  - [X] figure out a way to plot the 4 unperturbed, with the 28 overtop
    - [X] 28 overtop should then be greyscaled acccording to projection
  - [ ] interpret at what k points the electronic band is more or less projected onto the unperturbed state
    - [ ] speak to marcin - interpret results
    - [ ] look at different angles

- [X] tunneling coefficient gaussian
  - [X] NOT DOING THIS
    - [X] figure out decent fitting parameters for gaussian
    - [X] implement gaussian as function of k, G
    - [X] in hamiltonian swap constants with gaussian values
    - [X] plot bands
    - [X] interpret

- [ ] get a variety of plots for write up
