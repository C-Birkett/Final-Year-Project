abstract = {Commensurate-incommensurate transitions are ubiquitous in physics and are often accompanied by intriguing phenomena. In few-layer graphene (FLG) systems, commensurability between honeycomb lattices on adjacent layers is regulated by their relative orientation angle $\theta$, which is in turn dependent on sample preparation procedures. Because incommensurability suppresses interlayer hybridization, it is often claimed that graphene layers can be electrically isolated by a relative twist, even though they are vertically separated by a fraction of a nanometer. We present a theory of interlayer transport in FLG systems which reveals a richer picture in which the specific conductance depends sensitively on $\theta$, single-layer Bloch-state lifetime, in-plane magnetic field, and bias voltage. We find that linear and differential conductances are generally large and negative near commensurate values of $\theta$, and small and positive otherwise. We show that accounting for interlayer coupling may be essential for describing transport in FLG despite its physically insignificant effect on the band structure of the system. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

In coupled graphene-graphene and graphene-boron nitride layers, interesting physical phenomena ranging from Fermi velocity renormalization to Hofstadter's butterfly pattern have been demonstrated. Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides, another family of two-dimensional-layered semiconductors, can show distinct coupling phenomena. Here we demonstrate the evolution of interlayer coupling with twist angles in as-grown molybdenum disulfide bilayers. We find that the indirect bandgap size varies appreciably with the stacking configuration: it shows the largest redshift for AA- and AB-stacked bilayers, and a significantly smaller but constant redshift for all other twist angles. Our observations, together with ab initio calculations, reveal that this evolution of interlayer coupling originates from the repulsive steric effects that leads to different interlayer separations between the two molybdenum disulfide layers in different stacking configurations.},

abstract = {Lack of directional bonding between two-dimensional crystals like graphene or monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides provides unusual freedom in the selection of components for vertical van der Waals heterostructures. However, even for identical layers, their stacking, in particular the relative angle between their crystallographic directions, modifies properties of the structure. We demonstrate that the interatomic coupling between two two-dimensional crystals can be determined from angle-resolved photoemission spectra of a trilayer structure with one aligned and one twisted interface. Each of the interfaces provides complementary information and together they enable self-consistent determination of the coupling. We parametrise interatomic coupling for carbon atoms by studying twisted trilayer graphene and show that the result can be applied to structures with different twists and number of layers. Our approach demonstrates how to extract fundamental information about interlayer coupling in a stack of two-dimensional crystals and can be applied to many other van der Waals interfaces.},

abstract = {We present a three-band tight-binding (TB) model for describing the low-energy physics in monolayers of group-VIB transition metal dichalcogenides MX2 (M=Mo, W; X=S, Se, Te). As the conduction- and valence-band edges are predominantly contributed by the dz2, dxy, and d x2-y2 orbitals of M atoms, the TB model is constructed using these three orbitals based on the symmetries of the monolayers. Parameters of the TB model are fitted from the first-principles energy bands for all MX2 monolayers. The TB model involving only the nearest-neighbor M-M hoppings is sufficient to capture the band-edge properties in the ±K valleys, including the energy dispersions as well as the Berry curvatures. The TB model involving up to the third-nearest-neighbor M-M hoppings can well reproduce the energy bands in the entire Brillouin zone. Spin-orbit coupling in valence bands is well accounted for by including the on-site spin-orbit interactions of M atoms. The conduction band also exhibits a small valley-dependent spin splitting which has an overall sign difference between MoX2 and WX 2. We discuss the origins of these corrections to the three-band model. The three-band TB model developed here is efficient to account for low-energy physics in MX2 monolayers, and its simplicity can be particularly useful in the study of many-body physics and physics of edge states. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The LCAO, or Bloch, or tight binding, approximation for solids is discussed as an interpolation method, to be used in connection with more accurate calculations made by the cellular or orthogonalized plane-wave methods. It is proposed that the various integrals be obtained as disposable constants, so that the tight binding method will agree with accurate calculations at symmetry points in the Brillouin zone for which these calculations have been made, and that the LCAO method then be used for making calculations throughout the Brillouin zone. A general discussion of the method is given, including tables of matrix components of energy for simple cubic, face-centered and body-centered cubic, and diamond structures. Applications are given to the results of Fletcher and Wohlfarth on Ni, and Howarth on Cu, as illustrations of the fcc case. In discussing the bcc case, the splitting of the energy bands in chromium by an antiferromagnetic alternating potential is worked out, as well as a distribution of energy states for the case of no antiferromagnetism. For diamond, comparisons are made with the calculations of Herman, using the orthogonalized plane-wave method. The case of such crystals as InSb is discussed, and it is shown that their properties fit in with the energy band picture. {\textcopyright} 1954 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The behaviour of strongly correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades, but is still not well understood. This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity - which cannot be explained by weak electron-phonon interactions - in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1° - the first 'magic' angle - the electronic band structure of this 'twisted bilayer graphene' exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature-carrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 10 11 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

abstract = {A remarkable feature of the band structure of bilayer graphene at small twist angle is the appearance of isolated bands near neutrality, whose bandwidth can be reduced at certain magic angles (e.g., $\theta$∼1.05°). In this regime, correlated insulating states and superconductivity have been experimentally observed. A microscopic description of these phenomena requires an understanding of universal aspects of the band structure, which we discuss here. First, we point out the importance of emergent symmetries, such as valley conservation, which are excellent symmetries in the limit of small twist angles and dictate qualitative features of the band structure. These have sometimes been overlooked when discussing commensurate approximants to the band structure, which we also review here, and solidify their connection with the continuum theory which incorporates all emergent symmetries. Finally, we discuss obstructions to writing tight-binding models of just the isolated bands, and in particular a symmetry-based diagnostic of these obstructions, as well as relations to band topology and strategies for resolving the obstruction. Especially, we construct a four-band model where the two lower isolated bands realize all identified Wannier obstructions of the single-valley nearly flat bands of twisted bilayer graphene.},

Owing to the lattice structure and the strong atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) field, monolayer NbSe2 possesses Ising-type SOC which acts as an effective Zeeman field, leading to the unconventional topological spin properties. In this paper, we numerically calculate spin-dependent optical conductivity of monolayer NbSe2 using Kubo formula based on an effective tight-binding model which includes dz2, dx2-y2, and dxy orbitals of Nb atoms. Numerical calculation indicates that the up- and down-spin have opposite sign of Hall current, so the pure spin Hall current can be generated in monolayer NbSe2 under light irradiation, owing to the topological nature of monolayer NbSe2, i.e., finite spin Berry curvature. The spin Hall angle is also evaluated. The optically induced spin Hall current can be enhanced by the electron doping and persists even at room temperature. Our results will serve to design opt-spintronics devices such as spin current harvesting by light irradiation on the basis of 2D materials.},

The bulk nodal points appear on the $\Gamma$−M lines of the Brillouin zone where the Ising SOC vanishes.
